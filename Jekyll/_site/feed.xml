				<title>Best Horror Films in the Past 7 Years</title>
				        
				
					<description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-insidious-series-2010-present&quot;&gt;5. The Insidious Series (2010-present)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number five spot goes to the Insidious Series. I have chosen this because I really enjoyed watching all three films, however the third film seemed to lose some of its horror, which is common in a large amount of horror films in recent years. The second film brought fear however allowed to storyline to continue from the first, allowing to feel like the film was finished. The first film was incredible detailed in both the storyline and the acting from the amazing actors in the film. Luckily this was continued in both the second and third film allowing the trilogy to continue in this high quality films. This is why the trilogy has gained the fifth spot.&lt;/p&gt;
