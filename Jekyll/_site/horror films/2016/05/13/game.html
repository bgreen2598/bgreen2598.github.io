<h3 id="the-insidious-series-2010-present">5. The Insidious Series (2010-present)</h3>
<p>The number five spot goes to the Insidious Series. I have chosen this because I really enjoyed watching all three films, however the third film seemed to lose some of its horror, which is common in a large amount of horror films in recent years. The second film brought fear however allowed to storyline to continue from the first, allowing to feel like the film was finished. The first film was incredible detailed in both the storyline and the acting from the amazing actors in the film. Luckily this was continued in both the second and third film allowing the trilogy to continue in this high quality films. This is why the trilogy has gained the fifth spot.</p>

<h3 id="sinister-1-and-2-2012-and-2015">4. Sinister 1 and 2 (2012 and 2015)</h3>
<p>In the number four spot is Sinister 1 and 2. This is because I believe that both films was incredibly detailed as well as fear packed, with a good few jump scares keeping the watchers on their feet. Sinister 2 really wrapped up the story allowing for the ending, without talking about any spoilers. Sinister 1 was made extremely well with both the story and the actors that made the story come alive. Sinister allowed users to feel scared while watching the film as well as keeping them entertained with the adrenaline filled story line. This is why I have chosen the number four sport for these films.</p>

<h3 id="dark-skies-2013">3. Dark Skies (2013)</h3>
<p>Dark skies is the number 3 best horror film in the past 7 years. Dark skies is a SCI-FI horror film that is based around the abduction and stalking of humans by aliens. The film goes into great detail of how it happens as the weird events that begin to happen. The film allows for a sense of reality of this being possible if aliens was to come to Earth as well having the horror impact that is relied on in horror films. The storyline of the film is detailed to the tea as well as having one of the best endings of a horror film that I have seen in a while, allowing a different ending depending on how you viewed the film. This is why the film is taking the number three spot.</p>

<h3 id="orphan-2009">2. Orphan (2009)</h3>
<p>Orphan is a horror film, starring the horror film legend, Vera Farmiga. Orphan is the story of a mother called Kate, Vera Farmiga, living with her husband, Peter Sarsgaard,and two children Daniel, Jimmy Bennett, and Max, Aryana Engineer. After a miscarriage and an alcohol addiction the family adopt a nine year old girl called Esther, Isabelle Fuhrman. However Esther is not what she seems and the family now have to deal with her. The film brings a great atmosphere right from the word go. The films underlying plot line is amazing, allowing for the film to be watched more than once to see the information that would have been missed the first time it was watched. The ending of the film leaves the watcher over whelmed allowing for the film to leave the never forgetting ending. This is why Orphan has the runner up spot.</p>

<h3 id="mama-2013">1. Mama (2013)</h3>
<p>Mama will always be my favourite horror film to date. This is because of the films detailed storyline allowing for the watcher to get close with Annabel as well as the children, while allowing for the watchers to become scared through the several jump scares that are throughout the film. The ending of the film never gets old, allowing the the watcher to feel emotional for both mama and the family, even after watching the film more than once. The film is really well created allowing for the emotional meaning behind the film to effect the user even while allowing for the film to still be classed as a horror film. This film will always be the best horror film until another film can make a better emotional as well as fearful storyline, which is not boring or already been done.</p>
