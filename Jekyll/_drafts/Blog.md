### What I Have done at Strawberry- Monday. ###
Monday was my first day working at Strawberry. After being shown around by Callum I was introduced to the people that I would be working with for the week. After the stand meeting was completed I was then set tasks on Code Academy by Kat. The first task I had to complete was to learn how to make a website. After learning that I was set different tasks throughout the day linking with both HTML and CSS using Code Academy. 

### What I Have Done at Strawberry- Tuesday. ###
Tuesday was the second day that had been working here. Today I have begun to create the website using the software notepad++ using both HTML and CSS. I began by setting the layout using HTML for just the basics, such as the titles and paragraphs and linking my social media onto the site, which was based of my CV. After this I then began to style my website to make it look like my CV. This was done through coding the style with CSS, making the colours and the layout of the website look the same that my CV does. I then changed little bits that needed to be fixed and then create the META tags on the page. 

### What I Have Done at Strawberry- Wednesday. ###
Wednesday is the third day that I have been working here. Today I learnt about a software called git through Code Academy. I then began to to use git to create my website and make it public using the GIT URL. I created the website to have a homepage saying a little about me and then added a background and created the styling for the website. I then ensured the the previous website that I had created was linked to the website using a link, so people are still able to visit the website. I then ensured that all information that was confidential, such as my phone number was removed from the website. I then had to add add a place holder with a border and I began to learn how to use Google Fonts and I used one on my website for the title.  

### What I Have Done at Strawberry- Thursday. ###
Coming close to the end of the week at Strawberry I have began to learn how to use Jekyll and what Jekyll is. I had to create my first blog post using Jekyll, which you are reading now. I have then began to customise it and tried to understand how Jekyll works. I have not fully understood how to use the software yet and have been struggling today. However Mark has helped me though out the day, trying to help me understand how it works. Tomorrow I need to make a second blog post as well as customise both blogs though using a template and I have to include a set list of things of the front page. 

### What I Have Done at Strawberry- Friday. ###
On the last day at working at Strawberry I look back on one of the most amazing weeks I have had and remember all the things that I have learnt. Today I have created my second blog post as well as customised both blog posts using a template. I have begun to understand Jekyll a bit more after having Mark explain it to me more. I have also filled my Brew O Meter (Quantity) to the top and almost filled the standard bar to full. In my blogs I have centred the text as well as used Google Fonts to change the font and the colour of both the text and the background.
