<p>Monday was my first day working at Strawberry. After being shown around by Callum I was introduced to the people that I would be working with for the week. After the stand meeting was completed I was then set tasks on Code Academy by Kat. The first task I had to complete was to learn how to make a website. After learning that I was set different tasks throughout the day linking with both HTML and CSS using Code Academy.</p>

<p>Tuesday was the second day that had been working here. Today I have begun to create the website using the software notepad++ using both HTML and CSS. I began by setting the layout using HTML for just the basics, such as the titles and paragraphs and linking my social media onto the site, which was based of my CV. After this I then began to style my website to make it look like my CV. This was done through coding the style with CSS, making the colours and the layout of the website look the same that my CV does. I then changed little bits that needed to be fixed and then create the META tags on the page.</p>

<p>Wednesday is the third day that I have been working here. Today I learnt about a software called git through Code Academy. I then began to to use git to create my website and make it public using the GIT URL. I created the website to have a homepage saying a little about me and then added a background and created the styling for the website. I then ensured the the previous website that I had created was linked to the website using a link, so people are still able to visit the website. I then ensured that all information that was confidential, such as my phone number was removed from the website. I then had to add add a place holder with a border and I began to learn how to use Google Fonts and I used one on my website for the title.</p>
